# Factor_Graphs_in_HPC_Security_MP
The goal of this project is to understand the progression of a multi-stage attack that aims to leak secret keys from the target system. In this project, we perform data analysis of a multi-stage attack recreated from publicly available information on the Equifax breach. We explore the use of signature-based, anomaly-based, and factor graph-based analysis techniques.
